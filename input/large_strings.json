After an early goal from a corner, they kept pushing; another goal came after a swift counter; a possible goal was denied by the crossbar.\n\nAfter the interval, the visitors equalized with a scrappy goal. Minutes later, a deflection gifted the hosts a second goal. The captain urged patience, and a late team move produced the decisive goal.\n\nIn stoppage time, the keeper rushed forward for a last attack; a looping header almost became a goal, but the keeper recovered. As the whistle blew, chants celebrated each goal and the work behind every goal in training."
